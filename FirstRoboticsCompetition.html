        FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition. 
        <br>
        Each year, teams of high school students, coaches, and mentors work during a six-week period to build- 
        <br>
        robots capable of competing in that year's game that weigh up to 125 pounds (57 kg).
        <br>
        [4] Robots complete tasks such as scoring balls into goals, placing inner tubes onto racks, hanging on bars,- 
        <br>
        and balancing robots on balance beams. 
        <br>
        The game, along with the required set of tasks, changes annually. 
        <br>
        While teams are given a kit of a standard set of parts during the annual Kickoff,[5] they are also allowed and- 
        <br>
        encouraged to buy or fabricate specialized parts. 
        <br>
    <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> is one of five robotics competition-
        <br>
